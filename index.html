        annotation: "From his 2005 Stanford commencement address. At age 17, Jobs read: 'If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.' That quote inspired this daily practice, which he maintained for 33 years. This is how he stayed aligned with what truly mattered.",
        context: "Feb 28, 2026 — You're at a crossroads: can't afford HDB in Singapore without income. The question isn't 'what should I do?' — it's 'am I doing what I'd want to do if today were my last day?' Answer: Yes. You're building websites for restaurants, shipping demos, ready to send pitches. Keep going."

It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: 'Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.' It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.",
        annotation: "The origin of the mantra Jobs lived by. The Whole Earth Catalog (1974) — 'Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google' — signed off with this message. It meant: don't settle for the limited life society tells you to live. Everything around you was made up by people no smarter than you. You can change it, influence it, build your own things.",
